            <p>I created a simple mandala using Cubic Bézier curves in SVG. 
                I'll experiment with different ways to create mandalas with the 
                goal of creating interactive data visualizations. This one is static
                and is created using javascript to create SVG elements. The key to the round
                nature of mandalas was the transform rotation attribute in the SVG Path element.

            <h2>Advances in human gut microbiome research show its role in health. I have so many questions.</h2>
            <p><small>Posted on February 26, 2025</small></p>
            <p>How much influence does our gut microbiome have on our health? There are so many diseases that we have yet to understand. 
                Could some of them be related to our microbiome? In my reading of recent microbiome research so far, these are the health issues 
                that I've seen come up:
                Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Coeliac Disease, Type 2 Diabetes, Colorectal Cancer,
                Obesity, Hepatic Steatosis (liver), Rheumatoid Arthritis, Gout, Psoratic Arthritis, Eczema, Asthma, Kidney Disease, Acne, Osteoarthritis,
                Depression, Anxiety, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Autism, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease. 
                It's a lot, I know. I started this site because I want to create beautiful mandala data visualizations, so I will most likely
                start with some simple data sets. But I'd like to get to the point where I can show some data from scientific research.
                Will that help to clarify things? Maybe. 
            </p>
            <p>Can changes in diet heal gut problems and their corresponding health conditions? In my reading I'm seeing that adding fiber, probiotics, 
                and fermented foods to our diets can help. Removing some harmful ingredients from processed foods is a good idea.   
                And while not a diet change, also FMT (Fecal Microbiota Transplantation). There has been some success with FMT but could those same
                effects come further upstream, by restoring the microbiome from things like probiotics? 
            </p>
            <p>Some important papers in microbiome research include: 
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4290017/">"The gut microbiome in health and in disease" (PMC, 2015)</a> 
                        A review of research showing the microbiome's role in metabolic, immune and neurological health. </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001/full">
                        Human gut microbiota in health and disease" (Frontiers, 2022)</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>There are some accessible books out there. You could search by 'microbiome' or 'gut health'. 
                One that I've read is Super Gut by William Davis. It's very accessible
                and includes a step by step guide to healing your gut. Some people criticize it for it's lack of scientific citations, but 
                I recommend it if you're looking for a clear guide to healing.

            <h2>Hello World!</h2>
            <p><small>Posted on February 21, 2025</small></p>
            <p>Eric Lander once said 
                "Things that are beautiful have a communicative power that things that are not beautiful do not".
                When I was studying data visualization I was struck by the beauty that could be seen in data 
                and it's ability to create understanding. I was studying biomedical engineering at the same time so 
                I often used data visualization to help me understand complex biomedical data. 
                I've recently become interested in the impact of the gut microbiome on overall human health, so 
                I hope to share some of that research here and use data visualization to make it more understandable.
                I've just taken my previous website (flashbit.com) off of AWS and will probably forward it to this page.
                So if you are looking for flashbit and ended up here, that's why. I'm not sure which url I like better.
                Maybe some day I'll use them for two different purposes, but for now, this is my focus.

        <h3>About MandalaVis</h3>
        <p>I am planning to use this space to explore some data visualization techniques
            inspired by mandalas. 
            My background is a combination of software development and biomedical engineering. 
            My top two interests are
            <ol>
                <li>current research on the human gut microbiome and it's impact on overall health and</li>
                <li>trying to develop some beautiful mandala inspired data visualizations.</li>
            </ol>
            I will combine these two things so I'll post some of the latest microbiome research and try to make some 
            data visualizations with the goal of clarifying the data.
