    <p><h3>Making mandalas that I like.</h3>
        For this mandala I played around a little with the white space. In the center
        the white space makes a flower, or sun shape, and around the curved droplets
        some white leaf or petal shapes emerge.
        <h3>Moving towards mandala inspired data visualizations.</h3>
        The interactions are working pretty well now. Using the zoom buttons you can zoom in
        much further than the browser alone will let you. And, introducing dragging!
        You can now move the image around by grabbing and dragging it. </br>
        Finally, this is the first of my mandalas that is data driven. 
        The mandala is generated from a JSON data structure instead of being defined with lines
        of software.
         Notice that 
        every shape now has it's own description. Those descriptions are in the data, not written
        in lines of software.
        The data structure for this mandala is defined in javascript, on the client side. 
        So the next step is to send the json data structure from the server, created in python
        and representative of a dataset.
